        I am currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)</strong> at 
    <strong>Chandrabhan Sharma College (CSC)</strong> and am in my final year (<strong>TYBCA</strong>). 
    To strengthen my technical expertise, I have completed a <strong>Python certification from Spoken Tutorial, IIT Bombay</strong>. 
    Alongside my academic journey, I am actively working as a <strong>Computer Instructor at LCCWA</strong>, 
    where I share my knowledge of technology. My passion for innovation and critical thinking 
    was recognized when I secured <strong>1st place in the Tech Debate Competition</strong> at my college. 
    With a strong foundation in programming, data analytics, and problem-solving, I am committed to continuous learning 
    and growth in the tech industry.
